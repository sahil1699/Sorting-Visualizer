# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a Python project built with pygame that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, including Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. This README aims to guide you through the project's features and how to run it on your own machine.

## Project Overview

![Quick Sort Visualization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52308072/189471144-f2c97538-281b-406f-9886-3835edb62e95.gif)

The project offers an interactive interface that allows you to visualize different sorting algorithms in action. It's a great tool for understanding how these algorithms work and how they compare in terms of efficiency.

## Adjusting Array Size

You can change the size of the array being sorted using the following buttons:

- ![Small Array](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52308072/88691002-ec799500-d119-11ea-9504-599a0dbefc21.png): Click this button to reduce the array size.
- ![Large Array](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52308072/88690846-b76d4280-d119-11ea-99f5-07e1e0807d28.png): Click this button to increase the array size.

The default size is set at the beginning of this README file.

## Algorithm Selection

Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms to visualize. The available options are displayed as buttons:

## Visualizing Sorting Algorithms

Once you've selected an algorithm, click the respective button to start the visualization. You will witness the algorithm in action:

## Stopping and Shuffling

At any point during the visualization, you can stop the algorithm or reshuffle the array by clicking the following buttons:

- ![Stop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52308072/88690503-5e051380-d119-11ea-8a25-eedf46bcd85b.png): Use this button to halt the algorithm.
- ![Shuffle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52308072/88690503-5e051380-d119-11ea-8a25-eedf46bcd85b.png): Click this button to shuffle the array randomly.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project on your PC, ensure you have Python 3.7.0 or a later version installed. Then follow these steps:

1. Install pygame using pip:

   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Clone this repository using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sahil1699/Sorting-Visualizer.git
   ```

3. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you've cloned the project, and execute the following command to start the visualizer:

   ```
   python SortingVisualizer.py
   ```
